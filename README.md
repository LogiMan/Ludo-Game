Introduction

This is a simple Ludo Game implemented in Python. The game allows 2-4 players to roll a dice, take turns, and follow Ludo rules. Players roll a dice to move their tokens, and rolling a 6 grants an extra turn. The game continues until the maximum number of dice rolls is reached.

Features

Players take turns rolling a 6-sided dice

If a player rolls 6, they get an extra turn

Turns automatically switch to the next player if they donâ€™t roll a 6

Game stops after 15 rolls
